# Inbox

Quick notes, feedback, and todos. Process into plan.md periodically.

## Chores

## Feedback

- [x] search and columns selector at the same row
- [ ] resize side panel width
  - [ ] persist in localstorage
- [ ] avoid "-" for empty field.
- [x] README.md: requires anki restart when changing python code
- [ ] `toolbarLeft` feels odd

## Ideas

- [ ] persist last selected model in local stroage
- [ ] dedicated input for tag (multi select)
- [ ] setup e2e
- [x] remove research.md (move to inline comment if it's still worth)
- [x] document agent workflow (e.g. branch, commit, confirm before function change/fix)
- [ ] error boundary
- [x] "noUnusedLocals": true"
