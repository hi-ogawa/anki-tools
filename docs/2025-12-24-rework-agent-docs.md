# Rework Agent Documentation

Simplify AGENTS.md and docs structure.

## Goal

- AGENTS.md: Dev workflow only (commands, testing, conventions)
- docs/TODO.md: Single flat task list (open items only, remove when done)
- architecture.md: Removed - agents read code for details
- Planning docs: Date-prefixed, ephemeral

## Tasks

- [x] Create docs/TODO.md (open items only)
- [x] Rewrite AGENTS.md (streamlined)
- [x] Delete docs/architecture.md
- [x] Delete docs/inbox.md
- [x] Delete docs/plan.md
- [x] Rename planning docs with YYYY-MM-DD- prefix
